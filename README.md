# Documentação do Projeto: Exemplo de Uso do Nodemailer

## Overview
This is my first self-made project from scratch, made in a simple way and named V1 because I intend to make enhancements in the future.
I asked myself "How they send us those 4 random numbers to authenticate something?", waited for long enough and started to figure it out on my own by doing this little project.

## Technologies
- Node JS
- Express JS
- Nodemailer
- dotenv
- Bootstrap
- nodemon (As a development dependence)

## Pre-requirements
- Node.js
- email account
- Extra security settings (Generate a app key ONLY if you use a gmail account!)
- Set enviroment variables (listed in the .env.example file)

## Install
To install the project dependencies, please run this code in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
